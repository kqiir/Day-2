1. A block Level element is a element that will consume the entire width that is available (ex. Paragraph, h1-h6, division element <div></div>)

2. A inline element doesnt consume the whole width, but only uses as much space as it Needs meaning you can or will have more than 1 inline element next to each other if you dont use a line break <br> (ex. span)

3. A div (Content Division Element) is a container that is used to divide a document into sections for better overview or practical Styling.

4. primarly div is used to capture block Level portions of a document while span is practical for specific inline portions of a document. a span can be inside of a div but a div cannot be inside a span because block Level Elements are not allowed inside inline Elements.
